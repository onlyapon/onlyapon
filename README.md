## Research

### Label-Efficient Medical CT Segmentation

Adapted joint-embedding predictive pretraining to 2.5D CT slice pairs and tested which natural-image design choices survive the shift to volumetric medical data.

- Designed controlled leave-one-out ablations for slice separation and masking strategy
- Evaluated data efficiency through linear probing and end-to-end fine-tuning across five label budgets
- Corroborated the central finding with SwinUNETR, a held-out CT dataset, and CT-to-MR transfer
- Quantified run-to-run reliability with repeated seeds and Welch's t-tests

### Auditing Memorability Guidance in Text-to-Image Diffusion

My undergraduate thesis audits training-free predicted-memorability guidance by differentiating AMNet through the DDIM trajectory of Stable Diffusion. The emphasis is not merely whether a proxy score rises, but whether the effect transfers beyond the optimizing critic and remains competitive with simpler sampling alternatives.

- Held out ResMem and ViTMem from guidance and evaluated transfer across datasets and seed bases
- Used prompt/latent-paired comparisons, prompt-clustered inference, and an outcome-untouched test set
- Compared guidance with prompt modification and best-of-four reranking
- Characterized Goodhart-style failure modes through directional controls and a native-resolution SDXL diagnostic

### AI-Assisted Stomatal Phenotyping

A cross-disciplinary chickpea study benchmarked instance-segmentation systems for guard-cell complexes and stomatal pores under control and drought conditions.

- Benchmark scale: **506 microscopy images** and **6,605 annotated instances**
- Evaluation design: 359 training, 99 validation, and 48 locked test images
- Model comparison: YOLOv8s-seg, YOLO26s-seg, and Mask R-CNN under a common test protocol
- Main limitation: small-pore segmentation, followed by the need for repeated runs and external validation

| Best observed test result | Model | Mask AP |
| :-- | :-- | --: |
| IoU 0.50 | YOLO26s-seg | 0.638 |
| IoU 0.50:0.95 | Mask R-CNN | 0.428 |
